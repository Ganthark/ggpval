## This is a fix of recent CRAN check warning:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_ggpval.html

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.  

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies for ggpval, there were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
